## 🧩 Overview

**SalaryIQ** is a full-stack machine learning application that estimates an employee's annual salary (in USD thousands) based on their professional profile. The model was trained on a dataset of 50,000 job records using a Gradient Boosting Regressor — the best-performing algorithm among 7 models evaluated.

The application features:
- A sleek dark-themed UI with interactive sliders and dropdowns
- A FastAPI backend that serves predictions in real time
- A preprocessing pipeline that exactly mirrors the training notebook
- Live deployment on Render

---

## ✨ Features

- 🎯 **Instant Salary Prediction** — get results in under a second
- 📊 **Confidence Range** — every prediction includes a ±8% salary band
- 🎛️ **Interactive UI** — smooth sliders and dropdown selectors
- 🔌 **REST API** — clean `/predict` endpoint for programmatic access
- 📱 **Responsive Design** — works on desktop and mobile
- ⚡ **Lightweight** — no database, no auth, no overhead

---

## ⚙️ How It Works

```
User Input → FastAPI Backend → Feature Engineering → GBR Model → Salary Prediction
```

1. User fills in their job profile on the UI
2. The frontend sends a `POST /predict` request with the input data
3. The backend applies the exact same preprocessing pipeline used during training:
   - **One-Hot Encoding** for 4 categorical features (alphabetical sklearn order)
   - **MinMax Scaling** for 2 numerical features using original training ranges
4. The pre-trained GBR model predicts the salary
5. The result is returned with a ±8% confidence range and displayed on the UI

## 🔌 API Reference

### `POST /predict`

Predict the salary for a given job profile.

**Request Body**
```json
{
  "jobType": "MANAGER",
  "degree": "BACHELORS",
  "major": "COMPSCI",
  "industry": "WEB",
  "yearsExperience": 10,
  "milesFromMetropolis": 20
}
```

**Response**
```json
{
  "predicted_salary": 127.45,
  "salary_range_low": 117.25,
  "salary_range_high": 137.65,
  "confidence_note": "GBR · 50k job records · OHE + Manual MinMaxScaler pipeline"
}
```

> Salary values are in **USD thousands per year** (e.g., `127.45` = $127,450/year)
